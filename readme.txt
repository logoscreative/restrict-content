== Description ==

Restrict Content to registered users only. This is a simple plugin that will allow you to easily restrict complete posts / pages to logged in users only. Levels of restriction may also be set. 
For example, you can restrict content to only Administrators, Editors, Authors, and Subscribers.

Content restriction works both with shortcodes and drop-down menu of access levels for complete posts / pages.

v2.0 is also now completely compatible with custom post types.

== Installation ==

1. Upload restrict-content to wp-content/plugins
2. Click "Activate" in the WordPress plugins menu
3. Go to Settings > Restrict Content and customize the Message settings
4. Follow instructions below to restrict content

To restrict an entire post or page, simply select the user level youâ€™d like to restrict the post or page to from the drop down menu added just below the post/page editor.

To restrict just a section of content within a post or page, you may use shortcodes like this:

[restrict userlevel="editor"] . . . your restricted content goes here . . . [/restrict]

Accepted userlevel values are:
 - admin
 - editor
 - author
 - subscriber
 - contributor
